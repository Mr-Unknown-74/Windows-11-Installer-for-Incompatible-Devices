This program uses code from "Skip TPM Check on Dynamic Update v12", made by AveYo on GitHub.
https://github.com/AveYo/MediaCreationTool.bat/blob/main/bypass11/Skip_TPM_Check_on_Dynamic_Update.cmd
#
 - This software takes genuine Windows 11 ISO files and then will install them onto incompatible devices.
It's for the people who are tired of Windows 10 or have an incompatible PC on Windows 11 21H2 that you want to update to 22H2.

 - If you ran the program, but it crashed or you stopped it, don't worry, you can run it again and it will uninstall, and then ask you if you want to reinstall

 - A great advantage of this program is that you won't lose your data when you update!
#

# HOW TO USE:

1. Run 'Win11-Install_2.2.1.cmd'
     - Note: If you do not run it as administrator, don't worry! It will automatically trigger a UAC prompt in order to gain administrator access.

3. Now just select the Windows ISO file that you want to install, give it a second to open the Windows installer, and then go through the windows installer as normal.

4. After Windows 11 is installed, you can run 'Win11-Install_2.2.1.cmd' again to uninstall the program.
     - Note: If you chose to install windows normally, you would not need to uninstall the program, but if you decide to run the program again, it will automatically unmount your iso, if it was not already unmounted.
